Hello! I don't know why you're here, unless you're looking at this for information or you're a judge. Either way, commits are in commits. Code is in versions. Changelog is under changelog. etc. etc. Hopefully I didn't miss anything.

Anyways, welcome to the codebase for 67002B, aka 2B-Determined!

Here you will find every version of the code that we have used after switching from our first robot, the T-38 Talon, to the new and improved P-40 Warhawk. The code will be updated regularly, as soon as changes are made and tested. No updates will be made mid-competition unless there is a large amount of time avaliable, and nothing else is being done.

The Warhawk is set up as such: (Note that none of the ratios include external gearing, only the gear cartridge ratio is mentioned)

6 motor 6:1 drivetrain (3 motors per side)

1 motor 36:1 catapult

1 motor 6:1 intake and color roller wheel

Using config.h, you can change any of the avaliable settings for your setup. Motor ports, cartridges, manual control buttons... everything is possible!
